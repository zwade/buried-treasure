# Buried Treasure

What buried treasure awaits in this place?

## Build

To build the project, run

```bash
yarn
node maze.js
node shell.js
```

Then to start it, host the files in `outdir` with any webserver. The easiest way is

```bash
cd outdir
python3 -m http.server
```

And then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Solution

This is a fully client-side problem, but it employs some fun browser features. No spoilers until after testing.
